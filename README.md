# Windows Dublication Removal with NodeJS
Welcome, and thenk you for looking at this open-source project of mine. If you have any additions to the project, please make a PR and I will take a look at it.

## What is this project for?
One of my friends needed to check their computer for dublicated files, I made this script to check and "Gather" them. Gathering them in a folder for the user to decide if they wish to delete it or put it somewhere else.

## How much time did I spend on this?
Too much... like, 4-8 hours of time spent on this. Mostly because I wanted it to be a little fancy :)
